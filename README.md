- **Threading optimization**: Dedicated threads for capture, processing, and encoding
- **Resource management**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks during long recordings

### Better Organization
- **Separation of concerns**: Each module handles specific functionality
- **Easier debugging**: Issues isolated to specific components
- **Code reusability**: Modules can be used independently

### Maintainability
- **Simpler updates**: Modify features without affecting the entire codebase
- **Better testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
- **Cleaner documentation**: Each module is self-contained and documented

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**FFmpeg not found**
- Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
- Set path in UI or add to system PATH
- Use "Test" button to verify installation

**Audio recording fails**
- Install: `pip install sounddevice soundfile`
- Check device permissions
- Try different audio devices

**Poor performance during long recordings**
- Lower FPS setting (15-20 for 10+ hour sessions)
- Use region capture instead of full screen
- Disable unnecessary overlays
- Close other applications
- Use the new modular version (app_new.py) for better memory management

**Video file corrupted**
- Ensure sufficient disk space (estimate ~1GB per hour at 1080p/20fps)
- Check output path permissions
- Try different output location

### Performance Tips for Extended Recording

**Memory Management**
- The modular architecture (app_new.py) provides better memory efficiency
- Use region capture for smaller memory footprint
- Monitor system resources during recording

**Storage Planning**
- Plan for ~1-2GB per hour depending on resolution and FPS
- Use fast storage (SSD) for best performance
- Consider disk space for temporary audio files during processing

**System Resources**
- Close unnecessary applications
- Use lower FPS for extended sessions (15-20 FPS)
- Monitor CPU temperature during long recordings

## macOS Permissions

On first use, macOS will prompt for Screen Recording permission. Grant it under:
